# wastewatertreatment
control program for the emergency & temporary wastewater treatment plant in Altenahr, 
which was installed in April 2022 after the catastrophic flood from Juli 2021.
This temporary control program ran successfully by a Raspberry Pi Zero WH 
connected to a LOW-Triggered relais board from May until July 2022.
With many thanks to Ludwig, Calvin, Kurt and Christoph for their hardware support, 
the friendly commitment and that you all tried it with me and this program!

Far away from professional or object-oriented programming I tried to write a 
simplified code, only using if-else-while statements, to support easy understanding
for non-computer engineers.
