# wastewatertreatment
#control program for the emergency & temporary wastewater treatment plant in Altenahr, 
#which was installed in April 2022 after the catastrophic flood from Juli 2021.
#This temporary control program ran successfully by a Raspberry Pi Zero WH 
#connected to a LOW-Triggered relais board from May until July 2022.
#With many thanks to Ludwig, Calvin, Kurt and Christoph for their hardware support, 
#the friendly commitment and that tried it with me and this program!
